            For this piece, we began exploring ways to use audio to interact with the artwork. <br>
            By applying noise operators to a sphere, we created a form that, when meshed, resembles a blossoming flower. <br>
            The audio-reactive element of this creation is highly versatile, offering greater flexibility than motion capture. <br> 
            This innovation has the potential to enhance any art piece we produce. <br> <br> 
            Our goal is to introduce this technology in music venues and develop additional applications to expand its use and impact. <br> <br>
