        <p class="explanation jost-light"> 
                Our first project, "The Swarm," marked our initial exploration of art through code. <br>
                Initially developed using Python, we transitioned to TouchDesigner to exploit its advanced capabilities.  <br> <br>
                Inspired by Craig Reynolds' Boids program, "The Swarm" is modeled using three mathematical principles: 
                separation, cohesion, and alignment. <br> 
                With this project, we aimed to illustrate the seamless connection between nature and technology,
                emulating the fluid movement of a flock of swallows. <br><br>
                Our goal is to challenge viewers' perceptions, 
                prompting them to reconsider the boundaries between art and technology.<br>
                
                Our mission is to blend technological understanding with artistic expression, <br>
                immersing audiences in our creations and encouraging a deeper appreciation of the technology that surrounds us.<br><br><br>
