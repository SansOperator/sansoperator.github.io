        We are Sans Operator, a team of two scientists studying at Imperial College London with a passion for digital art and creating immersive experiences. <br>
        Our journey began at the start of 2024, supported by our university through the Hackstarter competition program. It was here that we produced our first artwork, 'The Swarm.' <br> <br>
        
        This project marked our initial foray into prototyping art through code. We started with iterations in Python before transitioning to TouchDesigner to leverage its advanced capabilities. <br> 
        Among many STEM-focused projects, our creation won the People's Choice Award, which motivated us to push the boundaries of digital art even further. <br> <br>
        
        Our aim is to blend our understanding of technology with art to immerse audiences in spectacular experiences, breaking down stigmas associated with technology and fostering a deeper appreciation for the innovations around us. <br><br>
